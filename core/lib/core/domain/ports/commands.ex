  Sends an invoke command to a worker passing a struct with the function name, module and the code (wasm file binary).
  The command is sent directly to an handler PID in the Worker, which should have already received the
  invoke_with_code request.
  The arguments of the call are already saved Worker-side.
  The worker will store the wasm file in its cache, so subsequent invokes can be done without passing the code.
  It requires a worker (a fully qualified name of another node with the :worker actor on), a PID for the handler
  and a function struct.
